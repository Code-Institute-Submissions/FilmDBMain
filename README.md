FilmDB - Milestone 3 Project

My Milestone project has been created as a combination of the 3 modules in the Python series of the Full Stack Developer course. These include
Python Fundamentals, Practical Python and Data Centric Development. Using these knowledge from these 3 modules, I have been creating a responsive
web application using the CRUD functionailty. CRUD allows the application the user to create, read, update and delete information on movies to 
help create a shared passion for movies and television in my application FilmDB.

Project Functionailty


Design 







My Milestone 3 project is named FilmDB (Film DataBase). It's a API that allows user to be able to add content to a website with a functional databse at the backend. It's designed with fans of screen entertainment in mind who want to contribute to a working site to improve other users knowledge on Films and TV.

Due to the amount of information on the website, there are multiple pages to allow interactivity in various categories. There's also a Sign Up/ register and Log in page which a user will need to do in order to add content to the site. The data they enter will be stored in the Database at the back end and this is the creative idea behind FilmDB

There will also be a page for moderators and the option for someone to become a moderator will be setup. Moderators will be fans and so they will end up having a valued input behind the website helping it to be ran by fans for fans.

A moderator will keep an eye for bad language in a review. A bad review is acceptable but we want this website to be used by all ages and so if a child stumbles across a review done by an adult that contains foul language, this will be removed from the website under the Terms and Conditions.
