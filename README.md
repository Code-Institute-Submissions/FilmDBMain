[FilmDB](https://film-db.herokuapp.com/) - My Milestone 3 Project

My 3rd Milestone project has been created as a combination of the 3 modules in the Python series of the Full Stack Developer course. These include
Python Fundamentals, Practical Python and Data Centric Development. Using the knowledge from these 3 modules, I have created a responsive
web application using the CRUD functionailty. CRUD which stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete allows the user to add information to the application. It has been designed for users who have a shared love of movies to help create an open source database between fans of the silver screen.

### Project Goals

### User Experience - UX

## User Goals

* This website has been designed with a target audience of movie enthusiasts. 

  * To share what they think of what they see in todays visual entertainment market. A fan can watch any type of movie they want excluding adult material films and upload information about it. If it's a multi million pound oscar winner that's designed to showcase the talents of a new or existing director, a multi million pound flop with an incredible cast list all the way down to a free handheld open new movie by an unknown director starting their career. They've put their heart and soul into the film and shared it on YouTube, the users at FilmDB can watch it, review and share the film for others to see. I want this to be an easy to use quick experience that will grow as time goes. It's for everyone and it stems from the most passionate of the small and large screen art form. The website is an open source application and technically built by the users to create word and mouth of everything they see.

* Users all over the world will be able to access the site and so the choices can come from anywhere. UK, America, Foreign Films from Germany, Norway or the Middle East. Anyone can use the site to put their opinion down.

* This will then lead to users variety of what they watch and so they're not stuck with the same old category all the time. Their viewing opinions can be broadened if they've never thought about a type of film but a good review will spark the users interest. A new foreign film set in Sweden about drugs or an American art house piece about a lonely city in Texas. Who knows what the user will discover.

* FilmDB will hopefully be a great place to start their journey into something new. Help bring new directors to peoples screens to help bring new stories to life and not just endless remakes or constant sequels. Fast and Furious anyone!!


## Registed and Logged in User Experience

## What I want the website to work as


### User Stories

* For any user, I would like:

1. Them to be able to use the website to search for a movie they have an interest in or they've heard about. Once done, they can then search the database and find reviews on the film. If they find one, great but if not, they can create a review and leave it for someone else.


2. I don't want it to be confusing to the user and cause anything that might put them off from using the site.

3. Everything is laid out and presented well, it's simply informative and each items is easy to use and understand and follow.

4. Searching for a movie is a simple experience and they can find more information out as there is a link to the imdb site for more info if they need it.


### Design 


![]()

* This Milestone 3 project is named FilmDB (Film DataBase). It's an API that allows a user to be able to add content to a website with a functional 
databse at the backend. It's designed with fans of screen entertainment in mind who want to contribute to a working site to improve other 
users knowledge on Films. Due to the amount of information on the website, there are multiple pages to allow interactivity in various 
categories. There's also a Sign Up/ register and Log in page which a user will need to do in order to add content to the site. The data they 
enter will be stored in the Mongo Database at the back end and this is the creative idea behind FilmDB. There is also a contact us page which someone can use to either contact the creators of the site or ask about becoming a moderator as the site is currently unmanaaged. The idea behind the site is the users look after it so it self evolves. Moderators will be fans and so they will end up having a valued input behind
 the website helping it to be ran by fans for fans. A moderator will keep an eye for bad language in a review. A bad review is acceptable but 
 we want this website to be used by all ages and so if a child stumbles across a review done by an adult that contains foul language, this 
 will be hopefully be seen by a moderator and removed or edited.



## Project Design

* I like to design my web sites with a bold image as the main focal point and as a key feature. The image makes an impact when thr user first lands on a page. The image is instantly recognisable and sets the design and tone of the entire website. I like the websites I design to be built around the image and including the colour scheme, the fonts and the entire layout of the page. I chose strong clear images including great characters from movies and TV. Whether that character is from a classic film or a well structured TV show, they makes a lasting impression on the audience. 

* I chose a floating menu instead of a Nav bar because it stands out on the page. It's been hard to get the layout working with the menu but I believe it was a great feature to add.

### Design


* As you can see in the wireframes and concept section further down, I kept pretty close to my original design. I tried various colour schemes for the heading title but I wanted something that worked well with the background image, the red and black gradient colour looked great with both the image and the color of the borders with the black sci-fi background. The white coloured font stood better in the header comapred to black or grey which lost impact when I made the title bar opaque.

I looked at other sites that had a similar theme to mine and I felt mine was different enough to stand out and be something completely new and fresh and to look cool to a user.

I had to think how to showcase the site to a user and tried to make it engaging from the moment the user clicks on the first page.

### Logo

### Colours

* For the most part, the images used create the colour scheme themsleves. A bold image was chosen to add a poster effect, like a movie poster. Then, I chose a colour scheme that would sit well on top of the images and so a white font used for all the wording. A Red and Black gradient used as the main header of the website finished off the design. Then simple Red, black, White and touch of green for successful login was fresh but retro and worked well together.


### Images

* The image chosen was used because it's an instantly recognisable character from the world of cinema from in the past 40 years. The target audience will range in variation and so I had to think of something that was striking, not a frightening image for smaller children but cool enough to bring people to the site. The image I chose I believe represented this idea very well and the image stood out in the overall design of the site. 

### Styling

* I like the applications I design to be clean without being over the top and so I did the same with this. No over wording on the pages, just something to get you started.


### Fonts

* As standard when building a site, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and spent time looking through the options. I wanted something that looked futuristic to tie in with the image and engaging to the user. Chosen Fonts: Montserrat

[My page](https://film-db.herokuapp.com/)

* A website built for Film lovers that can share their passion!!

* The project I’ve designed is for my third milestone project for the Data Centric Development module of the Full Stack Developer Course. I’ve used Flask and Python to design the majority of layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and sits within the HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. 

  This is a Multi Page Applciation website. Users are able to login to a Mongo Database which works in conjunction with Heroku and WTForms.There's an API in the background that allows the user to search for Films and even TV from screen entertainment. As mentioned, there's a contact page which as well.


### Original wireframe concepts

* The wireframes below were the original design I had in mind. A bold header and the images were to be sat on a blank background. How I visualised
  it and how it showed were very different and it was much duller on screen. The images which hadn't been chosen at the time might have brought it 
  into a better light but I reviewed other sites and they either had a similar design or something more dramatic.

* Original Full Screen Design

* Changing it to a design more along the lines below made an impact straight away. It had colour giving a better overall layout and made
  a difference from the moment I added the background image. Nothing else but that image changed everything. I could then layer over the 
  top of it and add my original plan. I was able to build from the bottom up and show something more with imagery.

* Full Screen Design - Displays great, really happy with the results and it's responsness. Splits as it should when minimised.


* Mobile Design - The only slight issue which I wasn't able to rectify no matter how many screen changes I made was the smaller pixel 
  sized screen when the images were more centralised and so the skier character wasn't as visible. He is meant to be slightly seen
  on all devices with the images slighlty pulled to the left so he's displayed.

### Project Goals

![](/assets/images/flipimage1.jpg) 


* The primary goal of FilmDB was to 


### User Objects

* The website has been designed for film fans that want to learn, share and inform others about film. It's an open source design where users can tell anyone and everyone about a film they've just seen.

* Aimed at movie enthusiasts who want to spread knowledge of cinema and film.

* Sharing something passionate about film
* Finding that film information from sone that loves or loathes a movie.
* Easy to use
* A clean site with clear easy to use information
* Bright and engaging for the user
* Striking with identifiable comment
* Searching for a film through the search option and finding the review.

### FilmdDB helps a user learn about a filn before viewing because:

* Designing the site was done with the user in mind. Nice big easy to use guides and short descriptions. This helps the user to understand how to use the site.
 
* It's easy to navigate around the site and use the options available.


### Developers Objects

* Nicely designed and content friendly with a well thought out user experience.
* The layout is formatted in a way that the user can navigate around the site without frustration.
* A professionally mutli paged aite with includes Python, Jinga, complex HTML and CSS.

### Future plans

* Offer a larger search functionality
* Add a movie trailer option


### Site Features

### [Home Page](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer)

* Being a SPA, you never leave the one page. You can do everything all in one place and the necessary features come from that starting point.

* All revolving images as stated have a location button which displays the map. The information button holds brief content and a video to watch. 


### Hopes for the website are:

* A user can navigate around the site with ease and simplicity

* The website can be used to find the perfect holiday 

* It allows a user to start their dream and passion

* It's found to be a nice design that allows each user to move around the site comfortably.

* It's clean, clear and easy to use.


 * There will always be bold adventurers looking for something new. Watching the amazing documentary Free Solo, it showcased how far someone
   will go to fill that need and addiction for something different. I wanted this site to be bold, colourful but all in one easy to use
   place. Design and Conquer is a website I was going to add to my portfolio from a few years ago but I neved made it. As a project, I thought this was
   perfect to use for the holiday allowance project for the course and allows me to showcase what I've learnt.


### Technologies Used


* HTML
* CSS 
* Python Flask
* MongoDB
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

* Bootstrap was used to build a solid and yet simple structure which allowed the site to be responsive easily.

* The same IDE was used but it moved from one product supplier of just Cloud 9 to AWS (Amazon) Cloud 9 for all the above languages.
 
* [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

* IMDB and The OMDB were used as guides and references for my site. The OMDB API was used for the movie search function on my website. 

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* Google was used for stylising the website fonts as it gave me a great selection to choose from. 

* [Favicons](https://www.favicon.cc/)

* Favicons was used for the URL toolbar icon



 [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
 
* Autoprefixer was used to correct issues within the CSS which prevented the page displaying on products using Safari and made sure
  all css prefixes were up to date.

* Microsoft Word - I used this product to crop images which I used for my README.md file.

* Vimeo - Searching on Vimeo allowed me to find a strong video for each holiday selection which have only been used for educational purposes.



### The goals for the website are:

* To be seen as an easy to use resource for movie enthusiasts wanting to learn or add something new in regards to a film theu're passionate about. Also, it showcases my working knowledge of various software
  languages which I've learnt during the various sections leading up to the MS3 project.



### Media and Content

* The images were searched and found on Google

* All content was written by myself.

### Code

* I've used various code for this website all written fresh. I did get an understanding for part of the code by deciphering some of Anthony O'Brien's and Paul Bennet's code. It was generic code, nothing direct from their content but I had an issue with the hashed encryption and I had it the wrong way around. I was also using encode instead of decode. I spoke with tutors but the one's I spoke with had used the Werkzeug security system and so I was advised to speak to others who had used bcrypt. Anthony and Paul had done so they showed me their code so I could put mine in the correct order to allow the login to work. Registering was fne but Login was causing me issues.


* HTML - All code produced by Matthew Lister except for the content such as the main background image. This was searched and found on Google Chrome and
then added into img source code which I had put together. I used script tags from Google Fonts to display the correct formatted fonts.

* Python and Flask - All code produced by Matthew Lister with some support from CI tutors and the review of Anthony and Paul's code to assist resolving an issue i had.

* CSS - All CSS code was produced by Matthew Lister originally typed to add styling to the HTML page. This included Font styling, image sizing and
colour choices

### How I’d like the website to be perceived:


* This website would be an easy to use site to help users search for Movies and TV and to share site what they love or hate about their choices.

* They have a keen interest in the silver screen and it's smaller counterpart and this site will help them to share their interests and broaden their knowledge.

* A nice clean UX multi page designed site. Choose your option and start your journey. Show others what you love and help to share that with them.



### Issues and setbacks whilst building the site and time taken (that should be my nickname)

* THe site works fine across all browsers which is great but on small mobile devices, the navbar caused me issues. Either the Header title or the Navbar would not sit right at the top of the page. Changes to both caused major display issues on other devices so it was a headache trying to resolve the issue.

* I struggled with some of the CRUD stuff and multiple pages but help from tutors got me through the process. I spent a lot of time researching things myself and got far but the last parts I struggled with. It needed a 2nd persons eyes to spot those small mistakes and advise on the changes. I really need to contact a tutor sooner rather than later.

### Testing and Bugs

* I tested the website on multiple browser platforms including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. I used Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox at different points whilst designing the site due to some caching issues in Chrome at times. 

* As always with my projects, they take me a while to do as I've struggled with the course. Workkng on site has been good though and I've learnt a lot. Testing was done by my family to see if they could navigate around the site and this worked well, especially when my daughters saw there names displayed on screen so they got a personal feeling which is nice.

* I also asked for the site to be tested through Slack in Peer Review which gave me some great feedback.

* I ran my code through validators on a regular basis such as the [W3c Validator] and through [PEP8]



### Registration and Login Design

I added security to my application and built templates and the functionailty into the app.py file. This included the following:

A registration technique that posted a user's accepted details to the MongoDB collection in the database.

Once registered, I created the Login part of the process which allowed a user to login respectively and they were then able to work with the CRUD system and Create an entry, Read an entry, Update an entry or Delete an entry to build the Database.

The security built acted in the following process:

1. Register, if already registered, a "Go to the Login page" function was added.
2. If passwords don't match when registering, a "Passwords do not match" message pops up.
3. If a user is already registered with that name a "That username is already registered, please choose another" message is displayed.
4. Login, if not registered, "Go to the registration page" function was added.
5. If password is incorrect, a "Password is incorrect message is displayed"
6. Logged in twice, a flash message "You crazy kid, you're already logged in" was displayed.
7. Once logged in or registered, a green outlined box is shown showing "A successful login" and you'll also have that displayed on the home page when the user is logged in.
8. The logged in name is also displayed when a delete is made.


### Software Deployment and Software Cloning Technologies Used:

* This project was developed using the GitPod IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software. The data was then pushed to GitHub also using the GitPod IDE.

* The project was regularly pushed to the GitHub repository https://film-db.herokuapp.com/ and published to GitHub and Heroku pages using GitPod commands. Please read the guides below.

* First, I used the following as pre made template base for my site provided by Code Institute: 

GitHub Full Template Used as part of the process including software extensions for GitPod [Gitpod-Full-Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

### Deployment to Github

### When deploying FilmDB from the [GitHub repository](https://film-db.herokuapp.com/), I used the following process:

### Cloning the repository

1. Open the GitHub dashboard and choose the repository.
2. Under repository name, select the "Clone or download" green button located to the right of the page.
3. Select the "clipboard icon" on the right hand side of the page to copy the URL of the clone.
4. In your own IDE, open a terminal window.
5. Change the current working directory to your location of choice where you'd like the directory to be made.
6. Paste your Git URL which you copied and click "OK".
7. Then Press Enter and your local clone will be created.


### I used default commands to push to Github but I also had to prepare for the Heroku part of the process and so once logged in:

* I first had to install the Heroku software using the following commands:

1. npm install -g heroku and press enter.
2. Enter heroku login -i and press enter.
3. You'll need your email and password that you used to login to Heroku with to create your project.

* Once done, I was then at the Heroku "logged in" prompt so each command I entered pushed to GitHub and also Heroku so using the following commands updated both instances of the project.

* git status when checking what needed uploading.
* git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
* the changes I make.
* git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.


### To run the project locally

* To run this project within your own IDE such as GitPod, Visual Studio or PyCharm, you'll need the following installed on your machine as they are necessary tools needed for the sites creation:

[PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) Is a standard package management system used to install and manage software packages specifically written in Python.

[Python3 (Mine is MAC SPECIFIC)](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) Prerequisites for installing Python3 on MAC


### Back to Heroku Deployment (Windows Deployment is different and explained within the course)

To deploy FilmDB to Heroku, I used a Linux based system as I have an Apple MacBook Pro laptop.

1. I had to download and install the Heroku CLI software and run: brew install heroku from the command line. This makes it easier to create and manage the Heroku application direct from the command line.

2. I had to create a requirement.txt file using a terminal command: pip freeze > requirements.txt.

3. Then, I had to add to create a Procfile using the following command: echo web: python app.py > Procfile.

4. I then had to push the files to GitHub. git add (Enter) git commit (Named commit) which adds the requirements and Procfile to GitHub. Then using the git push command, it updates to my GitHub repository.


## The next stage pushing to Heroku

### We know the commits push to GirHub but I need the commits I make to reflect within Heroku and so to do this, I have to create a new Heroku application by doing the following.

1. Create an account and log into the Heroku website. Then, Create a new app by clicking the "New" button in the dashboard. You need to name the application so I gave mine the same name as the application I'm creating and then set the region to Europe.

2. On the Heroku dashboard, you'll see Deploy. You need to click on "Deply" > "Deployment method" and select Github. 

3. Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct GitHub repository. This ties the two applications together.

4. Once done, you'll need to add the settings to tie Heroku in with Github, the application you are building and the Mongo DataBase you have created. So, first from the Heroku dashboard of the applcation, click on "Settings"> "Reveal Config Vars"

5. Set the config vars as follows:

| Key     | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DEBUG  | FALSE       |
| IP   | 0.0.0.0     |
| MONGO_URI  | mongodb+srv:/<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-qtxun.mongodb.net/            <database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority      |
| PORT  | 5000        |
| SECRET_KEY  | <your_secret_key>     |

 * You're MONGO_URI is specific to YOUR site, to create your own, read the MongoDB Atlas deocumenation [Found Here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/)

 6. Back in the Heroku dashboard, click the "Deploy" button.

 7. In the Manual Deployment section of the page, make sure you have the master branch selected. Now click "Deploy Branch".

 8. Your site has now been deployed successfully.

### For my friends currently working on their Milestone 3 projects.

* I'm happy if youy'd like to use my readme file as a reference and guide as an    example of how to write a strucured milestone project. The format will hopefully
  be of use to you but it is not ok to copy directly from mine for your own project. 

Thank you for your understanding,

Kind Regards,

Matthew
