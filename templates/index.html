	<p1> At FilmDB (DataBase) WE LOVE MOVIES and we want the same for you.

		FilmDB is a movie and database built by you, the user. The site has been designed as an open source website
		where you add the info about your favourite movies to help build FilmDB. You add the reviews, you add the films
		you love and so you help build the passion of the website.

		We hope your contributions will help others to learn about movies and find something new. We welcome all and
		encourage everyone to use the platform of this site to help build the world of movies.

		As an independent site, reviewers contributions are golden and we would love everyone that comes here to add
		something. Genuine reviews are what we’re after. If you have passion for a film, say so, if you hate it with a
		passion, say so.

		We want our community to be the best and to help us become the best. Now, this is open source but we also want
		it to be a sensible open source site and so we do have moderators. I know rules right, no one likes them but we
		do have to have them. We don’t want some young child coming to read about Toy Story and finding loads of
		horrible swearing about bad animation but hey!! It’s a beautiful film so don’t diss Toy Story.
