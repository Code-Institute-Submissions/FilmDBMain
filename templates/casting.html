    <h1>Casting</h1>
    <p> Welcome to the Casting page.</p>
    <p> Whose that guy from that film? He was in that superhero film. A good actor or even a bad one can make a film or tv show and
        help it become one of the best pieces of entertainment you've seen or make it the worse things ever in your mind. For us, 
        Bullerproof Monk is high on that list. But, a great cast carries the magic of what we see through the screen. </p>
